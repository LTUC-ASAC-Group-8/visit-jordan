        My first visit was a week-long, the second was a month. My third and fourth visits were about 3 weeks each and
        in
        2019 I visited for three weeks in March and two weeks in July 2019.
        While most of my close friends and family have stopped saying I am crazy to go to the Middle East, I still get
        many people who ask “Is Jordan safe?” when I say I spend a lot of time in Jordan with my young boys and feel
        completely comfortable, whether it is in Amman, Petra, or Wadi Rum.
      </p>

        From arrival to departure, everything was taken care of. Everything explained for the day, and tours of ancient
        wonders told in fantastic detail.

        thank you "visit jordan" team, re-telling of ancient times. they kept the whole tour group engaged all the time,
        but also gave us free time to relax. If any dilemma rose, they was swift in rectifying it, a sign of a very
        personable operator. I have recommended to many people i have spoken with here, about my trip - that they should
        travel to Jordan and use this website

        Wooow wooow wooow i think jordan’s rich blend of culture, history and scenery has long been a draw. Several
        civilisations have come and gone over the centuries, the distinct influences of which can still be felt today.
        Jordan played a key role in the powerful Umayyad empire in the early seventh century and has historically been
        home to the Nabateans, Egyptians, Ottomans, Romans and Greeks.
